# About this project

üìñ Read the [The System Design Checklist](https://evelyne24.github.io/system-design-checklist/).


## What this checklist is

This is a checklist of things to think about when designing or re-designing a software system or parts of it.

For example, a specialised, shorter version of this checklist can be used to design:

- an Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a pre-PMF company
- a microservice for a post-PMF company
- a migration process from a monolith to a microservice architecture
- a logging and monitoring system for external auditing
- a frontend component
- a new API endpoint etc.

## What this checklist is not

This is not a tutorial on software system design. However, as a refresher, I added a few notes about _**why**_ certain questions are important and some opinionated suggestions. Feel free to skip over them.

## How I came up with the checklist

 I've successfully used checklists my entire life, as a software engineer, during my time as a CTO of an early-stage fintech app, where I designed software for high-street banks and when I prepared for the [AWS Solution Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) exam. I created a mental checklist to:

- extract the system requirements from the question
- determine the desired system properties
- break down the system layers
- consider trade-offs at each layer

This is how I was able answer 60+ scenario-based questions in 120 minutes and pass the exam üôå.

## Why I made the checklist public

We are bombarded by new information every day. There are many books and articles on software system design. Technologies, frameworks, languages, practices change at huge speed.

<mark>However, most of them lack a practical format, to apply the knowledge **immediately**. Also, Our brains can't cope well with so many long-form texts, day-to-day. </mark>

I noticed a move towards checklists and flowcharts in the developer community. Therefore, this repository is the first step towards a practical tool. I want to help not only first-time CTOs, but any software team before a routine design task.

I hope the checklist accomplishes three goals:

1. Helps them **discover unknown unknowns** by sparking curiosity and reflection ahead of the design task.
2. Inspires them to **use it in Pre-Mortems**, to better assess high-impact, high-risk systems, and **in Post-Mortems**, to update it with learnings discovered the hard way.
3. Used and refined frequently, it **builds good habits** leading to high quality work.

‚ÄúChecklists [‚Ä¶] remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.‚Äù ‚Äî Atul Gawande, The Checklist Manifesto


## How to contribute to the checklist

If you like the checklist, let's make it more useful together! üí™ 

<mark>Mistakes are human nature. Because technology advances so quickly, what was good-enough yesterday may not be tomorrow. Nobody can know everything at all times.</mark>

You're very welcome to contribute to fix mistakes, and refine the list of questions and options by submitting a Pull Request.

I'm running some tests with real teams from a few companies to benchmark if the usage of a checklist results in:

> - shorter `commit ‚Üí review ‚Üí deploy` cycles
> - improved code quality
> - increased number of issued discovered ahead
> - fewer severe incidents
> - better knowledge loops in and between teams

If you want to try it, email me at evelina@vrabie.info. Feel free to leave a comment with suggestions to make it more specific or shorter for certain cases, like the ones I mentioned in the first paragraph.

### How to run Jekyll locally
